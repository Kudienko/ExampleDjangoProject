Sequence-driven features for prediction of subcellular localization of proteins;"protein sequence feature extraction; subcellular localization prediction; support vector machine;";Prediction of the cellular location of a protein plays an important role in inferring the function of the protein. Feature extraction is a critical part in prediction systems, requiring raw sequence data to be transformed into appropriate numerical feature vectors while minimizing information loss. In this paper, we present a method for extracting useful features from protein sequence data. The method employs local and global pairwise sequence alignment scores as well as composition-based features. Five different features are used for training support vector machines (SVMs) separately and a weighted majority voting makes a final decision. The overall prediction accuracy evaluated by the 5-fold cross-validation reached 88.53% for the eukaryotic animal data set. Comparing the prediction accuracy of various feature extraction methods, provides a biological insight into the location of targeting information. Our experimental results confirm that our feature extraction methods are very useful for predicting subcellular localization of proteins.;2
Signatures versus histograms: Definitions, distances and algorithms;"distance between histograms; signature; earth mover distance; second-order random graphs;";The aim of this paper is to present a new method to compare histograms. The main advantage is that there is an important time-complexity reduction with respect to the methods presented before. This reduction is statistically and analytically demonstrated in the paper.;3
Multisets mixture learning-based ellipse detection;"ellipse detection; multisets mixture learning; hough transform;";We develop an ellipse detection algorithm based on the multisets mixture learning (MML) that differs from the conventional Hough transform perspective. The algorithm developed has potential advantages in terms of noise resistance, incomplete ellipse detection, and detecting a multitude of ellipses.;4
FuzzyBagging: A novel ensemble of classifiers;"classifier design and evaluation; machine learning;";In this work, a new method for the creation of classifier ensembles is introduced. The patterns are partitioned into clusters to group together similar patterns, a training set is built using the patterns that belong to a cluster. Each of the new sets is used to train a classifier. We show that the approach here presented, called FuzzyBagging, obtains performance better than Bagging.;1
